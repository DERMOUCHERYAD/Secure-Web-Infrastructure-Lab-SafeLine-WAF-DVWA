# 🔐 Secure Web Infrastructure Lab – SafeLine WAF & DVWA  
### Cybersecurity Practical Lab Report

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a full **cybersecurity lab report** documenting the setup, configuration and testing of a secure web infrastructure using:

- SafeLine Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- A vulnerable application (DVWA)
- A LAMP server (Apache2, PHP, MariaDB)
- Reverse proxy architecture
- Self-signed SSL/TLS certificates
- Local DNS override
- Attack simulation with Kali Linux

This document demonstrates both **offensive techniques** (SQLi, brute force, HTTP flood) and **defensive mechanisms** using a modern WAF.

## 📄 Included File
The repository contains a single document:

- **WAF Cybersecurity Lab Report (PDF)**  
  Complete walkthrough of the infrastructure, installation steps, security concepts, attack scenarios, and SafeLine WAF analysis.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand how a modern **Web Application Firewall** works  
- Deploy DVWA on a LAMP stack  
- Configure Apache to run on a custom port  
- Implement HTTPS using OpenSSL certificates  
- Configure reverse proxying through SafeLine WAF  
- Test blocking of common web attacks  
- Analyse logs & behaviour of a WAF under attack  

---

## 🧰 Lab Components (Summary)
- **Kali Linux** → Attacker  
- **Ubuntu Server** → DVWA host  
- **SafeLine WAF** → Protection layer  
- **Local DNS** → `/etc/hosts`  
- **SSL/TLS cert** → OpenSSL self-signed  
- **VirtualBox (Bridged Network)**
